THINGS YOU NEED TO DO:
1) Install the latest version of python (Python 3.9 at time of writing) https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Open an administrator command prompt and type the following: 
    where python
3) Copy the path of the output. It should look something like this:
    C:\Users\[user]]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe
4) In "install.bat" and "run.bat", where it says:
    [PASTE THE OUTPUT OF "where python" HERE]
   paste the output of "where python" there, including the square brackets,
   however, don't remove the install.py or main.py
5) Double click "install.bat" to run the installer
6) Read the message bellow this one
7) Double click "run.bat" to ru the program

DIRECTIONS FOR USE:
1) Put all the files in the same folder as main.py
2) Open the files so you know where to look
3) Run "run.bat" by double clicking it
4) Watch the output and answer the prompts when questioned
   It'll ask you for the page numbers for the tables you want to create. On the pdf you sent me that's 8-9
5) Take the "calendarData.csv" and upload that to google calendar
6) Pray that it didn't fuck up
If it does fuck up feel free to email me: contact@rhodso.com and I'll try and sort it for you
